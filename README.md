# Pick-and-Place-Robot-with-Line-Following

### Description
This robot is based on ATmega2560. Due to the complexity of the task, all the programming was done in Atmel Studio at the register level. The robot was a line follower with a gripper mechanism to pick up and drop objects. It consisted of various sensors, such as a Sharp sensor, Color Sensor, and Infrared sensor. The arena was stored in the form of a matrix. We used the Dijkstra algorithm to navigate the robot from one place to another. Alongside the robot, a lift was created to transport the robot from one level to another. The lift was also autonomous, functioning when the robot arrived on it.

Made in the year 2019
